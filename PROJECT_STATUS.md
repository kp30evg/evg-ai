## 🐛 Recent Issues Resolved

### 🚨 CRITICAL: User Data Isolation Security Fix (January 9, 2025)
**Issue**: ALL users in a workspace could see the SAME person's private data (emails, calendar, contacts)
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocked production use
**Root Cause**: 
1. Empty users table - Clerk webhook was broken (referenced non-existent `companies` table)
2. No user filtering - All queries filtered only by workspaceId
3. Missing userId field - Entities table had no user-level ownership

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Database Schema**: Added `user_id` column to entities table with proper indexes
2. **Clerk Webhook**: Fixed to properly sync users from Clerk to Neon database
3. **User Sync**: Created scripts to sync all 12 existing users across 6 organizations
4. **OAuth Updates**: Gmail/Calendar now store userId with accounts for isolation
5. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints now filter by userId (calendar, email, contacts)
6. **Module Handlers**: Updated all modules to respect user context
7. **Entity Service**: Added userId support to core data service

**Current Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Complete user isolation implemented:
- Each user's emails are private
- Each user's calendar events are private
- Each user's contacts/deals are private
- Successfully synced 12 users to database
- All data queries now properly filtered by userId

**Files Modified**: 
- `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Fixed webhook handler
- `/lib/db/schema/unified.ts` - Added userId field
- `/app/api/auth/gmail/callback/route.ts` - User-specific OAuth
- `/app/api/calendar/events/route.ts` - User filtering
- `/lib/entities/entity-service.ts` - userId support
- Plus 10+ other files for complete isolation

### 🎯 CRITICAL: EverCore CRM Entity Relationship System (January 6, 2025)
**Issue**: Contacts with company names weren't creating/linking companies - they just showed "No Company"  
**Root Cause**: Frontend form collecting company names but not sending them to backend API  

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Frontend Integration**: Updated `CreateContactSheet.tsx` to send `companyName` parameter
2. **Backend Enhancement**: Enhanced `createContact()` function in `evercore.ts` to:
   - Accept `companyName` parameter via unified API router
   - Perform case-insensitive company name matching
   - Automatically create new companies when they don't exist
   - Establish bidirectional relationships between contacts and companies
3. **API Schema**: Added `companyName` to `createContact` endpoint schema
4. **Relationship Logic**: Implemented proper entity linking with detailed logging

**Current Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - When you create "Luis Garcia at Burger King":
- Contact is created with proper company link
- "Burger King" company is auto-created if it doesn't exist  
- Bidirectional relationship established (Luis shows "Burger King", Burger King shows Luis)
- Both entities appear in their respective CRM tabs

**Testing Verified**: Live tested with Playwright MCP - entity relationships working perfectly

### CRITICAL: Messaging System SQL Errors (January 3, 2025)
**Issue**: Command processing returning 500 errors, messages sending but backend failing  
**Root Cause**: Multiple SQL query errors due to schema mismatch between legacy and unified architecture  

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Schema Violations Fixed**:
   - `/lib/evermail/gmail-client.ts` - moved `createdBy` from top-level to metadata
   - `/app/api/auth/gmail/callback/route.ts` - fixed createdBy field placement
   - `/app/api/onboarding/integrations/route.ts` - corrected entity creation structure
   - `/lib/api/routers/evermail.ts` - fixed multiple schema violations

2. **SQL Query Errors Resolved**:
   - Malformed WHERE clauses: `where ("entities"."type" = $1 and  = $2)` 
   - Fixed missing `entities.createdBy` references causing empty SQL conditions
   - All queries now use `metadata->>'createdBy'` for user filtering

3. **UUID Conversion Issues**:
   - `/lib/api/routers/unified.ts` - added `stringToUuid()` helper function
   - All `ctx.orgId` references now properly converted to UUID format
   - Fixed workspace ID mismatch between Clerk orgId and database expectations

**Current Status**: ✅ Messages successfully send and appear in UI, core SQL errors resolved

### Previously Resolved:
1. **Gmail Shared Account Bug** (CRITICAL)
   - Fixed: Each user now has isolated Gmail connection
   - Impact: Enterprise-ready security

2. **Email Send Button Not Working**
   - Fixed: Added proper state management and click handlers
   - Added action buttons for email confirmation

3. **OAuth Redirect Issues**
   - Fixed: Proper redirect URI configuration
   - Must run on port 3000 for Google OAuth

4. **Command Processing Errors**
   - Fixed: Proper error handling in AI processor
   - Added fallback responses

## 🚨 DEVELOPER HANDOFF NOTES - CRITICAL INFORMATION

### ⚠️ UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED FOR EVERTASK (WITH CRITICAL WARNING)

**🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT CHANGE THE PROJECT BOARD VIEW STRUCTURE**
The project view at `/app/(platform)/dashboard/tasks/[id]/` uses a clean WorkOS-style board (`work-os.tsx`) that was specifically restored after being accidentally replaced with tabs. This clean, single-view board interface is the CORRECT design and must be preserved. Any UI improvements should enhance this existing structure, not replace it with tabs or multi-view layouts.

The EverTask module has complete backend functionality but requires UI/UX polish within the existing WorkOS board framework. While all features work, the visual design and user experience need refinement WITHOUT changing the core board structure.

**Areas Needing Immediate UI Work:**

1. **Projects Tab Visual Design:**
   - ProjectCard component has all data but needs better visual hierarchy
   - Progress bars, health indicators, and budget tracking need more sophisticated visualization
   - Card hover states and animations need refinement
   - Grid/list view transitions need smoothing

2. **Task Management Interface:**
   - Kanban board drag-and-drop works but needs visual polish
   - Task cards need better status indicators and priority badges
   - Subtask nesting visualization needs improvement
   - Dependency lines between tasks not yet visualized

3. **Project Detail Page:**
   - 6 tabs implemented but content layout needs design love
   - Overview dashboard metrics need better data visualization (charts, graphs)
   - Milestones timeline needs interactive Gantt-style view
   - Activity feed and comments sections are placeholders

4. **Modals and Forms:**
   - NewProjectModal has all fields but form layout is basic
   - EditTaskModal functional but needs better field organization
   - Date/time pickers need custom styling
   - Multi-select dropdowns need search functionality

5. **Missing Visual Features (Backend Ready):**
   - Gantt chart view (data structure exists, UI not built)
   - Calendar view (data exists, needs FullCalendar or similar)
   - Resource/workload heatmaps
   - Project templates gallery
   - Bulk operations UI
   - File upload drag-and-drop zones

**Design System Compliance:**
- Review `/context/style-guide.md` for brand colors and typography
- Ensure all new UI follows evergreenOS design principles
- Use Playwright to test responsive design across viewports
- Consider invoking design-review agent for major UI changes

**Quick Wins for Next Developer:**
1. Add loading skeletons instead of "Loading..." text
2. Implement toast notifications for task updates
3. Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N for new task, etc.)
4. Add empty state illustrations
5. Implement proper form validation with inline errors
6. Add tooltips for all icon-only buttons
7. Implement batch task selection with checkboxes
8. Add task quick-actions on hover
9. Implement command palette for power users
10. Add progress animations and transitions

### 🔥 **January 9, 2025 Session Fixes**

#### 1. **OAuth Connection Flow Issues**
- **Problem**: Redirect loop after Gmail OAuth - kept bouncing back to dashboard
- **Fix**: Added `isLoaded` check in layout to prevent premature redirects
- **Files**: `/app/(platform)/layout.tsx`

#### 2. **Gmail Sync Not Saving Emails**
- **Problem**: Sync showed "50 emails synced" but database had 0 emails
- **Fix**: Fixed SQL syntax errors in gmail-sync-with-isolation.ts using SQL template literals
- **Files**: `/lib/evermail/gmail-sync-with-isolation.ts`
- **Before**: `eq(entities.data.gmailId, messageId)` (syntax error)
- **After**: `sql\`data->>'gmailId' = ${messageId}\`` (correct JSONB query)

#### 3. **Inbox Showing "No emails"**
- **Problem**: Even after successful sync, inbox displayed empty
- **Root Cause**: `getEmails` query was filtering by `ctx.user?.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress` which was undefined
- **Fix**: Removed broken email filter, now properly shows all non-draft/trash/spam emails
- **Files**: `/lib/api/routers/evermail.ts`

#### 4. **Dashboard Stats Showing Zeros**
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed 0 unread, 0% response rate, etc.
- **Fix**: Added userId filtering to email count queries
- **Files**: `/lib/api/routers/evermail.ts`, `/app/api/gmail/stats/route.ts`

#### 5. **Syncing Page Stuck at 75%**
- **Problem**: Sync page stayed at 75% for 20+ minutes
- **Fix**: Added maximum 20-second timeout with automatic redirect
- **Files**: `/app/(platform)/mail/syncing/page.tsx`

### 🔥 **TODAY'S SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS** (January 19, 2025)

#### **MODULE 4: EverTask - Complete Project & Task Management System** ✅
**Achievement**: Built full-featured task management system rivaling Asana/Monday.com

**Problem Solved**: No way to manage projects and assign tasks to workspace members
**Solution**: Complete project management module with workspace collaboration

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Fixed Critical Workspace ID Issue**:
   - **Problem**: Using Clerk org ID (string) instead of workspace UUID caused database errors
   - **Fix**: Changed all `ctx.auth.orgId` references to `ctx.workspace.id`
   - **Files**: `/lib/api/routers/evertask.ts` - Updated all endpoints

2. **Workspace Member Integration**:
   - Integrated Clerk organization members for task assignment
   - Display workspace members with avatars in project view
   - Assignee dropdown populated with all workspace members
   - Files: `/app/(platform)/dashboard/tasks/[projectId]/page.tsx`

3. **Project Management Features**:
   - Create projects with name, description, privacy settings
   - Multiple view types: List, Board (Kanban), Dashboard
   - AI-powered project setup option
   - Link projects to other OS entities (deals, contacts)

4. **Task Management**:
   - Create tasks within projects
   - Assign tasks to any workspace member
   - Task status tracking (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)
   - Priority levels and due dates
   - Real-time updates

**Technical Components**:
- `/lib/api/routers/evertask.ts` - tRPC router with all endpoints
- `/lib/modules-simple/evertask.ts` - EverTaskService business logic
- `/app/(platform)/dashboard/tasks/*` - UI pages
- `/components/tasks/*` - React components

**Results**:
- ✅ Projects create successfully and navigate to detail view
- ✅ Workspace members visible and assignable
- ✅ Tasks can be created and assigned
- ✅ Multiple view types working
- ✅ Proper data isolation per workspace

#### **MAJOR FEATURE: Automatic Company Extraction from Email Domains**
**Problem**: CRM contacts showed empty Company column despite having email addresses
**Solution**: Built comprehensive company extraction system that:
- Automatically extracts company names from email domains (e.g., john@acme.com → "Acme")
- Handles complex subdomains correctly (e.g., hi@learn.therundown.ai → "Therundown", not "Learn")
- Filters out personal email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- Works on both new contact creation AND existing imports

**Implementation Details:**
1. **Created `extractCompanyFromEmail()` function** in `/lib/modules-simple/evercore.ts`
   - Intelligent domain parsing with TLD awareness
   - Handles country codes (.co.uk, .com.au)
   - Skips personal domains and common prefixes

2. **Updated Contact Creation Flow**:
   - Modified `createContactWithData()` to auto-extract companies
   - Stores both `companyId` (for relationships) AND `companyName` (for display)
   - Creates company entities automatically if they don't exist

3. **Fixed Gmail Import Path**:
   - Updated `/lib/evermail/gmail-sync-with-isolation.ts`
   - Now extracts companies when importing contacts from emails

4. **Migration Script for Existing Data**:
   - Created `/scripts/fix-contact-companies.ts`
   - Successfully migrated 367 existing contacts
   - Populated company names for all historical data

**Results**:
- ✅ All 367 existing contacts now have company names
- ✅ Future email imports automatically extract companies
- ✅ Manual contact creation auto-fills company from email
- ✅ Company column properly displays in CRM table

#### **Database Connection Error Fixes**
**Problem**: "No database connection string was provided to 'neon()'" errors in browser
**Root Cause**: Client-side components trying to access database directly

**Solution**:
1. Created tRPC routers for server-side operations:
   - `/lib/api/routers/workspace-config.ts` - Workspace configuration
   - `/lib/api/routers/entity-types.ts` - Dynamic entity management

2. Updated React contexts to use tRPC instead of direct DB access:
   - `/lib/contexts/workspace-config-context.tsx`
   - `/lib/contexts/dynamic-entities-context.tsx`

#### **React Warning Fix**
**Problem**: "Received false for a non-boolean attribute indeterminate"
**Solution**: Fixed EntityTable checkbox to use ref + useEffect for indeterminate state

### 🛠️ **TECHNICAL DEBT & KNOWN ISSUES**

1. **UI/UX Polish Required:**
   - EverTask UI is functional but needs professional design polish
   - Many "coming soon" placeholders in project detail tabs
   - Loading states are basic text instead of skeletons
   - No animations or micro-interactions
   - Forms need better validation and error handling

2. **Performance Optimizations Needed:**
   - Task queries not paginated (loading all at once)
   - No caching strategy for project data
   - Kanban board re-renders entire board on single task update
   - Missing debouncing on search inputs

3. **Missing Features (Backend Ready):**
   - Gantt chart visualization
   - Calendar view integration
   - File attachments UI
   - Comments/activity system UI
   - Project templates gallery
   - Recurring tasks interface
   - Bulk operations UI
   - Task dependencies visualization

4. **Code Quality:**
   - Some components exceed 1000 lines (need splitting)
   - Inline styles should move to styled components or CSS modules
   - Missing proper TypeScript types (using 'any' in places)
   - Need more comprehensive error boundaries

### 🔥 **LATEST UPDATE - January 20, 2025 (3:10 PM)**

#### **CRITICAL FIX: Restored Beautiful WorkOS-Style Project View**

**Problem**: The most recent commit had replaced the clean WorkOS-style project board with a complex tabbed interface (Overview, Tasks, Milestones, Files, Activity, Settings tabs) that ruined the user experience.

**Solution**: Completely restored the original beautiful project management view:
- **Removed**: All tabs and complex multi-view structure
- **Restored**: Clean, single-view WorkOS board that displays immediately on project click
- **Preserved**: Customizable columns (Task Name, Status, Assignee, Due Date, Priority)
- **Maintained**: Sectioned layout (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- **Kept**: Search, Filter, and Group by features at the top
- **Fixed**: Member avatars display at the top of the board

**Technical Changes**:
- Deleted the complex tabbed version from `/app/(platform)/dashboard/tasks/[id]/page.tsx`
- Restored `/app/(platform)/dashboard/tasks/[id]/work-os.tsx` from commit 9ea626a
- Created simple page.tsx that just imports the WorkOS view
- Fixed routing to use `[id]` instead of `[projectId]` to match navigation

**Result**: The project view now shows the clean, professional board interface directly without any tabs, exactly as originally designed. This is the UI that should be maintained going forward.

- `/components/evercore/entities/EntityTable.tsx` - Fixed React indeterminate checkbox issue
- `/lib/api/routers/workspace-config.ts` - NEW: tRPC router for workspace operations
- `/lib/api/routers/entity-types.ts` - NEW: tRPC router for dynamic entities
- `/scripts/fix-contact-companies.ts` - Migration script (can be run again if needed)

**Critical Files to Know (Email System):**
- `/lib/api/routers/evermail.ts` - Main email API (getEmails query is critical)
- `/lib/evermail/gmail-sync-with-isolation.ts` - Gmail sync logic with user isolation
- `/app/api/auth/gmail/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback that triggers sync
- `/app/(platform)/mail/syncing/page.tsx` - Syncing progress page
- `/app/(platform)/mail/page.tsx` - Main mail dashboard
- `/app/(platform)/mail/inbox/page.tsx` - Inbox view

**Important Patterns:**
1. **Always use SQL template literals for JSONB queries**: `sql\`data->>'field' = ${value}\``
2. **Always filter by userId**: Every query must include `eq(entities.userId, dbUser.id)`
3. **Use actual database IDs**: Don't use `stringToUuid()` - get real workspace/user IDs from DB
4. **OAuth tokens are encrypted**: Use base64 encode/decode for token storage
5. **Company extraction**: The `extractCompanyFromEmail()` function is exported and reusable
6. **Store both IDs and names**: Always store `companyId` (for relationships) AND `companyName` (for display)

**Current Data Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect Gmail" → OAuth flow
2. OAuth callback creates `email_account` entity with tokens
3. Callback triggers `GmailSyncService.syncEmails()` 
4. Sync fetches 50 emails from Gmail API
5. Each email saved as entity with userId for isolation
6. Syncing page polls for completion then redirects
7. Mail page loads emails via tRPC `evermail.getEmails`
8. Inbox displays emails filtered by current user
