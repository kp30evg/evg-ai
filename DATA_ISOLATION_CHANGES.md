# Critical Security Fix: User Data Isolation

## Problem Fixed
Previously, ALL users in a workspace could see the SAME person's private data (emails, calendar events, contacts, etc.). This was a MAJOR privacy and security issue that prevented production use.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Empty users table** - The Clerk webhook was broken (referenced non-existent `companies` table)
2. **No user filtering** - All queries filtered only by workspaceId, not by userId
3. **Missing userId field** - The entities table had no userId column for user-level ownership

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added userId column** to entities table (`/lib/db/schema/unified.ts`)
- **Created migration** to add userId column to existing database (`/lib/db/migrations/add-user-id-column.sql`)
- **Added indexes** for efficient userId queries

### 2. Fixed Clerk Webhook
- **Fixed `/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`**:
  - Changed `companies` references to `workspaces`
  - Removed non-existent fields
  - Fixed user creation flow

### 3. User Sync Implementation
- **Created sync scripts**:
  - `/scripts/sync-users-simple.ts` - Syncs all Clerk users to Neon database
  - `/scripts/run-migration.ts` - Adds userId column to entities table
- **Successfully synced 12 users** across 6 organizations

### 4. OAuth Integration Updates
- **Gmail OAuth** (`/app/api/auth/gmail/callback/route.ts`):
  - Creates/fetches database user
  - Stores userId with email_account entities
  - Filters accounts by userId
  
- **Gmail Sync** (`/lib/evermail/gmail-sync-simple.ts`):
  - Gets database user from Clerk ID
  - Associates all synced emails with userId

### 5. API Endpoint Updates
- **Calendar Events** (`/app/api/calendar/events/route.ts`):
  - Fetches database user
  - Filters events by userId
  
- **Entity Service** (`/lib/entities/entity-service.ts`):
  - Added userId to EntityQuery interface
  - Stores userId directly on entities
  - Filters queries by userId when provided

### 6. Command Processor Updates
- **Command Processor** (`/lib/modules-simple/command-processor.ts`):
  - Fetches database user from Clerk ID
  - Passes userId to all module handlers
  
- **EverCore Module** (`/lib/modules-simple/evercore.ts`):
  - Updated all functions to accept userId parameter
  - Passes userId through to entity creation

## Testing Required

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Create 2 test users** in the same workspace
2. **Each user connects** their own Gmail/Calendar
3. **Verify isolation**:
   - User A cannot see User B's emails
   - User A cannot see User B's calendar events
   - User A cannot see User B's contacts
4. **Test commands**:
   - "Summarize my contacts" - should only show user's own contacts
   - "Show my emails" - should only show user's own emails
   - "What's on my calendar?" - should only show user's own events

### Automated Testing Needed
- Unit tests for userId filtering in entityService
- Integration tests for multi-user scenarios
- API endpoint tests with different users

## Migration Steps for Existing Data

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-migration.ts
```

### 2. Sync Clerk Users
```bash
npx tsx scripts/sync-users-simple.ts
```

### 3. Associate Existing Data (Manual)
For existing entities without userId:
- Email accounts: Update to associate with correct user
- Calendar events: Update to associate with correct user
- Contacts/Deals: Update to associate with creator

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
- [ ] Update remaining module handlers (EverChat, EverCal)
- [ ] Add userId filtering to all remaining API endpoints
- [ ] Create data migration script for existing entities
- [ ] Add automated tests for data isolation

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add audit logging for data access
- [ ] Implement row-level security in database
- [ ] Add middleware to verify user permissions
- [ ] Create admin tools for data management

### Low Priority
- [ ] Performance optimization for userId queries
- [ ] Add caching for user lookups
- [ ] Create user activity dashboard

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- Basic user isolation implemented
- Each user's data is tagged with their userId
- Queries filter by userId to prevent cross-user access

### Future Improvements
1. **Row-Level Security**: Implement PostgreSQL RLS policies
2. **API Middleware**: Add authorization middleware to verify permissions
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all data access attempts
4. **Encryption**: Consider encrypting sensitive user data
5. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access control

## Impact on Performance
- Additional index on userId improves query performance
- Minimal overhead from userId filtering
- User lookup adds small latency (can be cached)

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Remove userId filtering from queries
2. Revert API endpoint changes
3. Keep userId column (no harm in having it)

## Success Metrics
- Zero cross-user data leaks
- All user queries return only owned data
- No performance degradation
- Successful multi-user testing
