✅ Chat UI Fixed! The infinite render loop has been resolved.

📝 Testing Instructions:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/chat
2. You should see the chat interface without console errors
3. Click on a user in the Direct Messages section
4. Type a message and press Enter or click Send
5. The message should appear in the chat

🔍 What was fixed:
- Removed 'activeChannels' from useEffect dependency array to prevent infinite loop
- This was causing the component to re-render continuously
- The chat interface should now be stable and responsive

💡 Tips:
- Make sure you're logged into the Evergreen workspace
- If you don't see other users, run: npx tsx scripts/sync-users-simple.ts
- Check the browser console (F12) for any remaining errors
- Check the terminal running 'npm run dev' for server-side errors

🎯 Direct Messaging Features:
- Click on any user to start a DM conversation
- Messages are stored in the database
- Each user's messages are properly isolated
- Conversations persist across sessions
