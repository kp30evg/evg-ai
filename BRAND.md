# Evergreen AI Brand Kit

This brand kit provides comprehensive guidelines for Evergreen AI, ensuring consistent application across all touchpoints: websites, apps, marketing materials, presentations, social media, merchandise, and more. Drawing from your company's ethos as a revolutionary "Business AI Operating System" — unifying data, enabling natural language commands, and orchestrating autonomous workflows — the kit embodies sleek minimalism, confident innovation, and a subtle "glow" of intelligence. Inspired by Apple's clean precision and Tesla's bold futurism, it positions Evergreen AI as the iPhone of enterprise software: transformative, accessible, and unassailable.

The vibe is "Apple sleek, Tesla glow, FAANG speed" — glass-like minimalism with punchy tech swagger. Use this kit to make every asset feel like a seamless extension of your trillion-dollar disruption narrative.

## Brand Overview
- **Mission**: Obsolete fragmented business software with a unified AI OS that turns natural language into autonomous action, enabling businesses to operate as a single, efficient organism.
- **Positioning**: Not just software — the infrastructure for the world's economy. Confident, revolutionary, democratizing.
- **Key Attributes**: Unified, intelligent, real-time, evergreen (timeless innovation, like enduring pine trees).
- **Target Audience**: SMBs, enterprises, executives tired of silos; global users from Mumbai vendors to German manufacturers.
- **Voice & Tone**: Confident and punchy (e.g., "Run the Numbers ›"). Direct, empowering, insightful. Avoid jargon; focus on outcomes like "Optimize everything — it happens." Use short sentences for impact, with a subtle swagger that conveys superiority over competitors like Salesforce's "Frankenstein architecture."

## Logo Guidelines
Your logo features two stylized pine trees (triangles with trunks) in line art, above the text "Evergreen A.I." in a modern sans-serif font, all in Evergreen Green (#1D5238) on a black or white background.

### Logo Variations
- **Primary Logo**: Full color (green on black) — use for dark modes or high-contrast scenarios.
- **Monochrome**: All white (on dark backgrounds) or all black (on light backgrounds).
- **Icon-Only**: Just the two pine trees — for favicons, app icons, or small spaces.
- **Stacked vs. Horizontal**: Stacked for vertical layouts (e.g., mobile); horizontal for headers.
- **File Formats**: Provide in SVG (vector), PNG (transparent), and EPS (print). Include high-res versions for print (300 DPI).

### Usage Rules (Do's and Don'ts)
Inspired by Apple's precision:
- **Do's**:
  - Maintain aspect ratio; scale proportionally.
  - Use on clean backgrounds for legibility.
  - Pair with your tagline: "The AI OS for Business" in Inter Regular.
  - Allow clear space: At least half the height of the pine trees around all sides.
  - Minimum size: 35px height (digital), 8mm (print) — measured by the pine tree height.
- **Don'ts**:
  - Alter colors, distort, rotate, or add effects (e.g., no shadows unless subtle UI elevation).
  - Use alone without context; always tie to brand name if space allows.
  - Place on cluttered patterns or gradients that reduce visibility.
  - Animate unless subtle (e.g., gentle growth effect for loading states, 120ms ease-out).
  - Imitate in custom icons; reserve for official use.

## Color Palette
A restrained palette evoking evergreen forests (timeless strength) with tech accents for "glow." Primary green for CTAs and brand elements; neutrals for clarity; accents for highlights like AI insights or badges.

Use hex codes for digital; provide CMYK/RGB for print.

| Category | Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | CMYK | Usage |
|----------|------------|----------|-----|------|-------|
| **Primary** | Evergreen Green | #1D5238 | 29, 82, 56 | 100, 50, 90, 50 | CTAs, logos, active states, headings. Conveys trust and innovation. |
| **Neutrals** | Pure White | #FFFFFF | 255, 255, 255 | 0, 0, 0, 0 | Backgrounds, cards, for a clean Apple-like canvas. |
| **Neutrals** | Charcoal Gray | #222B2E | 34, 43, 46 | 80, 70, 70, 90 | Primary text, for high readability on white. |
| **Neutrals** | Medium Gray | #6B7280 | 107, 114, 128 | 60, 50, 40, 20 | Secondary text, labels, muted info. |
| **Neutrals** | Light Gray | #E5E7EB | 229, 231, 235 | 10, 5, 5, 0 | Borders, dividers, subtle lines. |
| **Accents** | Soft Green Tint | #E6F4EC | 230, 244, 236 | 10, 0, 10, 0 | Badges, status indicators, success states — adds a gentle glow. |
| **Accents** | Gold Highlight | #FFD600 | 255, 214, 0 | 0, 15, 100, 0 | Ratings, stars, key highlights — for Tesla-like energy and emphasis. |

- **Guidelines**: Limit to 60% neutrals, 30% primary, 10% accents. Ensure WCAG contrast (e.g., text on backgrounds). For gradients: Subtle from #1D5238 to #E6F4EC for buttons or heroes, but sparingly to maintain minimalism.

## Typography
Inter (sans-serif) for modern, legible tech feel — like Google's clean sans-serif. It's open-source, versatile for web/print.

| Element | Font Family | Weight | Size (Digital) | Line Height | Usage |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Headings** | Inter | Semi-Bold (600) | 24px (Main), 16px (Sub) | 1.2 | Titles, CTAs — punchy and confident. |
| **Body/UI Text** | Inter | Regular (400) | 16px (Body), 14px (Labels) | 1.5 | Descriptions, commands — clear and approachable. |
| **Numeric/Emphasis** | Inter | Semi-Bold (600) | Same as body | 1.2 | Data, figures — for emphasis in dashboards or insights. |

- **Guidelines**: 
  - Fallback: System sans-serif (e.g., -apple-system).
  - Kerning/Tracking: Default for cleanliness; +0.5px for headings.
  - Hierarchy: Use size/weight for structure; avoid italics except for quotes.
  - Print: Scale sizes (e.g., 18pt headings); ensure embedding in PDFs.

## UI DNA & Design System
For digital products/websites, ensure a cohesive "sexy" feel: Minimal, fast, with subtle intelligence.

- **Grid System**: Strict 8px grid for spacing/alignment — promotes unification like your single data model.
- **Corner Radius**: 16px for cards, buttons, containers — rounded for approachability.
- **Shadows**: Subtle (e.g., 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) for elevation; avoid heavy for Tesla glow.
- **Animations**: 120ms ease-out for transitions (e.g., command responses unfolding).
- **Iconography**: Line icons in #1D5238; custom set inspired by pine trees (e.g., branching for orchestration). Use open-source like Feather Icons as base.
- **Buttons**: Primary: #1D5238 background, white text, 16px radius. Hover: Add #FFD600 border glow.
- **Cards**: White background, light gray border, subtle shadow — for workflow demos or competitive moats.

## Additional Elements
- **Icon Set**: Develop a custom library (e.g., AI brain, chat bubble, workflow arrows) in line style, matching logo.
- **Patterns/Textures**: Subtle green gradients for backgrounds; avoid overuse.
- **Photography/Imagery**: Abstract AI visuals (glowing networks, unified data flows); diverse global users. Style: High-contrast, minimal — no stock photos.
- **Templates**: Create reusable ones in Canva or Figma for pitch decks (e.g., "Trillion-Dollar Disruption" slide), emails, social posts.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure 4.5:1 contrast; alt text for logos/images.

## Implementation & Consistency Tips
- **Tools**: Use Canva for quick assets (upload this kit); Figma for UI prototypes; Adobe for print.
- **Sharing**: Store in a shared drive (e.g., Google Drive) or tool like Brandkit; require approval for deviations.
- **Audits**: Review quarterly; test across platforms (web, iOS, Android).
- **Legal**: Trademark "Evergreen AI" and logo. Do not allow third-party alterations.
- **Examples**:
  - Website Hero: Logo centered, green CTA "Start Orchestrating ›" on white.
  - Social Post: Icon-only logo, punchy copy: "Fire unprofitable customers? Done."
  - Merch: Black t-shirt with white logo, subtle green accents.

This kit ensures Evergreen AI feels revolutionary everywhere — from your website's "sexy" dashboards to global marketing. If evolving (e.g., new accents), update centrally. For questions, reference this as your evergreen foundation.
